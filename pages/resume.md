# **Experience**

### Data Science Fellow, General Assembly
(Oct. 2022 - Feb. 2023)


Successfully completed 500+ hours of expert-led instruction in statistics, data management, machine learning, and the industry's most in-demand technologies

**Capstone**: _A study of SMOTE pre-processing techniques in small imbalanced data_

- Studied effect of SMOTE pre-processing to solve for target imbalance in small data for both regression and classification. For regression, created a linear regression model on SMOGN pre-processed data to predict the incidence of cheating/hacking in games based on anti-cheat software and game description (NLP). For classification, used video game sales data and created logistic regression model to predict if a video game would generate over 10M sales based on various features of the game. Evaluated model results on regular vs. SMOTE pre-processed data.

_Project for Aviation Safety_

- Designed logistic regression model for plane safety regulators to predict the severity of an aviation accident based on contextual factors such as the model and make of the plane, and identify the most important factors as possible targets of regulation

_Comparing Language in FPS Games_

- Created Logistic Regression model to classify reddit posts as _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II_ subreddit or _Overwatch 2_ subreddit posts using NLP. Gathered data using Pushshift Reddit API and compared performance of classification models in Python. Determined that _Overwatch 2_ subreddit uses more niche gaming vocabulary than _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II_ subreddit. Free-to-play games such as _Overwatch 2_ may benefit from a niche language base as this may drive loyal, existing players to make in-game purchases

_Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa_

- Created Regression model to predict house sale prices based on housing characteristics using Python. Derived insights and made business recommendations for house-flippers in Ames, Iowa
