### Background

Reddit is a discussion website with subreddits for different categories. Many popular video games have subreddits where users discuss game updates, share their opinions, and share game content.

Two popular games are Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (which from here will be abbreviated as "COD MW2") and Overwatch 2. COD MW2 was released October 28, 2022 and Overwatch 2 was released on October 4, 2022. Both are first-person shooters which have multiplayer modes and are played on various platforms including PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox X/S, and Windows. Although there are different game modes for each game and the gameplay for each is different, they are both shooters with large and active Reddit communities, with the COD MW2 subreddit having 806k members and the Overwatch subreddit (which contains Overwatch 2 content) having 4.2 million members.

### Goal

The goal of this project was to classify reddit posts as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II subreddit or Overwatch 2 subreddit posts using natural language processing (NLP). We then looked at features which had high importance in classification to shed light on the two gaming communities. This was turned into actionable insights for the advertising departments/ agencies of the two game companies.
