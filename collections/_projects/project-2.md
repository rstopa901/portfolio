### Background

The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about all the aviation accidents that happened around thw world. This data includes both commerical and private airplanes. Since the invention of the airplane, humans have made major advancenment on airplane safety in order to make flying a very safe form of transportation.

Unfourtuantely, aviation accidents still occur all aroud the world. Recently, on January 15, 2023, a commerical airplane went down in  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/16/nepal-plane-crash-facebook-live-video">Nepal</a> and there multiple fatalties. Even with recent advacements, airplane safety and regulation is important and needs to be constantly looked at. This is why it is essential to study the aviation accident data in order to reduce and furhter accidents.

In this notebok, I will be looking at the US aircraft accident data from the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx">National Transporation Safety Board</a> to help answer my problem statement

### Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to design a model for the plane safety regulators that can predict the severity of an aviation accident based on contextual factors and identify the most important factors as possible targets of regulation.

In this project our group will be utilizing both an NLP and linear regression model to predict the highest injury severity based off other data in the database such as: make/model of plane, probable cause, and location.
