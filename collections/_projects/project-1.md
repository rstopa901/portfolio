For my capstone, I studied the effect of SMOTE pre-processing to solve for target imbalance in small data for both regression and classification. 

For regression, I created a linear regression model on SMOGN pre-processed data to predict the incidence of cheating/hacking in games based on anti-cheat software and game descriptions (NLP). 

For classification, I used video game sales data and created a logistic regression model to predict if a video game would generate over 10M sales based on various features of the game. I then evaluated model results on regular vs. SMOTE pre-processed data.
